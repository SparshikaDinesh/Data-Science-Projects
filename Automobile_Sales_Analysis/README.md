# Study of Automobile Sales: RFM Analysis, PCA, and Clustering

**Course:** Foundations of Data Science (FDS)  
**Tech Stack:** R, Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  

### Overview
This project analyzes automobile sales data using customer segmentation and dimensionality reduction techniques.  
We performed **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis**, **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for feature reduction, and **Clustering** to identify patterns in customer behavior and sales trends.

### Key Features
- Conducted **RFM analysis** to segment customers based on purchasing behavior  
- Applied **PCA** to reduce dimensionality and improve interpretability of sales features  
- Performed **K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering** for customer segmentation  
- Visualized clusters and sales trends using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**  
- Provided actionable insights for targeted marketing and inventory management  

### Files

- `Automobile_Sales_Analysis.ipynb` – Code implementation for RFM analysis, PCA, and clustering  

### Commit Message
Added README for Automobile Sales Analysis (FDS Project)
