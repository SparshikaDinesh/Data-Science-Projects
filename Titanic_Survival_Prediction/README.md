# Titanic Survival Prediction System

**Course:** Mining Big Data  
**Tech Stack:** PySpark, Hadoop, AWS EMR, Python, Random Forest, Logistic Regression  

### Overview
This project focuses on building a scalable big data pipeline for predicting Titanic passenger survival probabilities.  
Data preprocessing and feature extraction were performed using **PySpark**, and various classification algorithms were trained and tested to analyze large-scale passenger data efficiently.

### Key Features
- Implemented distributed data processing using **Apache Spark** on AWS EMR  
- Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and outlier detection  
- Trained multiple ML models including **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Gradient Boosted Trees**  
- Achieved **~91% accuracy** and identified top predictive features such as gender, passenger class, and age  
- Optimized runtime by 40% using partitioning and caching strategies
