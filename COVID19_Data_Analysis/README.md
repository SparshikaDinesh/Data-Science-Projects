# Analysis of COVID-19 Data: January 2020 to July 2020

**Course:** Fundamentals of Data Science (FDS)  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  

### Overview
This project explores COVID-19 data from January 2020 to July 2020 to understand the spread, trends, and key statistics of the pandemic.  
We performed data cleaning, aggregation, and visual analysis to derive insights into infection rates, recoveries, and fatalities across countries and time periods.

### Key Features
- Collected and preprocessed COVID-19 data from multiple sources  
- Performed **time series analysis** to track infection and recovery trends  
- Visualized country-wise and global statistics using **Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly**  
- Identified patterns in infection rates and recovery trends  
- Provided insights for public health awareness and policy planning  

### Files
- `COVID19_Analysis_Report.pdf` – Detailed project report including methodology, visualizations, and insights  
- `COVID19_Data_Analysis.ipynb` – Code implementation for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization  

### Commit Message
Added README for COVID-19 Data Analysis Project (Jan–Jul 2020)
