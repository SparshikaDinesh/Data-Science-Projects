# Road Traffic Accident Severity and Risk Analysis

**Course:** Fundamentals of Data Science (FDS)  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  

### Overview
This project analyzes road traffic accident data to identify factors affecting accident severity and risk.  
The analysis includes data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling to understand accident patterns and provide actionable insights for traffic safety improvement.

### Key Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed accident data from multiple sources  
- Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify patterns and trends  
- Applied **classification models** to predict accident severity  
- Visualized high-risk locations, contributing factors, and accident trends using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**  
- Provided insights for road safety measures and policy recommendations  

### Files
- `Road_Traffic_Accident_Report.pdf` – Detailed project report including methodology, analysis, and insights  
- `Road_Traffic_Accident_Analysis.ipynb` – Code implementation for data cleaning, analysis, and predictive modeling  

### Commit Message
Added README for Road Traffic Accident Severity and Risk Analysis Project
