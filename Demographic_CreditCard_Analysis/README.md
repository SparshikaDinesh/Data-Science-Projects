### Overview
This project analyzes the impact of demographic factors on credit card usage patterns.  
We performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and regression modeling to identify which demographic features (age, income, education, etc.) significantly influence credit card spending and ownership.

### Key Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed demographic and credit card usage datasets  
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify patterns and correlations  
- Applied **linear and multiple regression models** to quantify the impact of demographic factors  
- Visualized relationships between variables using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**  
- Provided insights for targeted financial marketing and risk assessment
